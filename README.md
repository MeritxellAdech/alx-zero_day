# Git Fundamentals
It is likely you know more about this topic than I can tell. Nevertheless, I would like to enlighten those who are interested.
**Git** is a **version control system** that is commonly used for **tracking changes in source code during software development**. It was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005.
Git is so popular and widely use due to its functionalities. There are many, but I will just mention some few ones below:
  * *Version Control*: Allows developers to track changes on their code over time. This feature basically records every modification made to files in a repository, creating a history of changes.
  * *Branching and Merging*: allows you to work on features or fixes in isolated branches and then merge them back into the main branch when they are ready.
  * *Collaboration*: Git facilitates collaboration among multiple developers. Repositories can be hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, allowing teams to work together on code, review each other's changes, and manage project issues.
  * *Staging*: Git has a staging area (also known as the index) where you can selectively choose which changes to include in the next commit. This allows you to craft clean and well-organized commits.

    In summary, Developers use Git to **manage code, collaborate with others, track changes, and coordinate software development efforts efficiently**.
Amazing, huh? There is more though but why killing yourself to learn it all now? Let us practice what you have just read.
